### "What can't javascript do now?"

I was able to add the (node.js)[http://nodejs.org/] example created by [Ben Evans](https://github.com/bencevans/fig-examples/tree/master/nodejs).
It only took me a couple minutes to get the demo working with fig-seed. Try it with:

python fig-seed.py sample bencevans-nodejs
