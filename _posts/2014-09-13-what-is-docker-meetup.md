What is [nsenter](https://github.com/jpetazzo/nsenter)?

It is a small tool allowing to enter into namespaces. Technically, it can enter existing namespaces, or spawn a process into a new set of namespaces. "What are those namespaces you're blabbering about?" We are talking about container namespaces.
