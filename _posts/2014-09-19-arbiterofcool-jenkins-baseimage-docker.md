### "The favour of the gods has given me a marvelous gift, which has never left me since my childhood. It is a voice which, when it makes itself heard, deters me from what I am about to do and never urges me on."

`docker pull arbiterofcool/jenkins-baseimage-docker`

Jenkins [Dockerfile](https://github.com/arbiterofcool/jenkins-baseimage-docker) now uses the ONBUILD command.
