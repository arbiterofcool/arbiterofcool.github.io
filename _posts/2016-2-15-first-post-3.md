I have been taking Group Power and Zumba classes. They have helped me immensely. I still need to remember that I am human. I have strained my shoulder and hip.

Throughout my career, I have not paid attention to economics. I am changing this. Voice dictation is a tool that I'm using. I just realized that I can have it help me with comments in my code.
