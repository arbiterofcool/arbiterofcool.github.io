I will be participating in the Tech Industry panel
during Career Panel Session C (11:39 a.m.-12:35 p.m.)

I passed the high school equivalency test the first quarter of my senior year. I tried to go to Santa Monica college but school just wasn't for me.  

I started programming professionally the day after I turned 18. My high school teacher introduced me to the guys that I work with. I worked with them for five years.

At the time of writing this, I am 33 years old. That means I have had a 15 year career. I worked across the full spectrum of tech companies. Building my own apps. Early stage start ups. Post acquisition startups. I am now working for the Bell Patent Association.
